# Disease-Recognizer
A Comprehensive Website instigated with a mere objective of making things easier for the senior citizens. The Problem Statement implies that Sunita Sharma is a senior citizen aged
over 65 years and with the context, I have opted to create a website for her which will help her determine the main disease behind the symptoms. There are various sections as such 
Symptoms, Age-Group where information is categorized. The Disease Recognizer emphasizes on locating the actual disease depending on the symptoms and syndromes. It is also very 
accesible patients can surf on the domain without any login prerequited as the aged people might find bit tricky to access. It also consist of a analytics section which will 
render a clear picture of an average percentage of the Patients Diagonsed with certain Diseases. There is still quite scope to make it more optimizable. The website is built 
using HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and CSS for the general structure. PHP scripts can be used to usher it towards Data Connectivity.
